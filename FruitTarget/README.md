# FruitTarget

Fruit Target is Arena Shooter game that I worked as Client Side Developer in VNG. The game is very light (35MB) but has nice graphic and gameplay. It can run smoothly on 512MB Ram devices which is the big advantage when aiming to developing market like India or Sea. Sadly, the director decided not invest anymore because after 3 months release, the game still not perform well due to various reasons.

The game has 2 modes:
  - Free mode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZaMvoBwHjA
  - Arena mode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdjNF7E5qQ

Technical used in Client:
  - Cocos2d-x framework.
  - C++.
  - Box2d for physic ingame.
  - Spine for animation.
  - Protocol Buffers for network.
  - Shader and OpenGL.
  - NDK, JNI, Obj-C for native functions.

What I've done:
  - Login System.
  - Tribe System (like Clash Royale).
  - Arena Mode 
  - Weapon UI Ingame
  - Player Profiles
  - Golden Fruit
  
and much more.

Best memorable moments:
 - Pass All QC round test without any bugs in a 2 weeks sprint.
 - Identify and fix a critical bug crash just 2 hours release plan.
 - The tribe system pass final QC round test
 - Win a closed match against my teammate.
