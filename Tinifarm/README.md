# Tinifarm

Tinifarm is the game that I spend my first 2 years as Client Side Developer in VNG with it. You will be a farmer in beautiful land. Everyday, you nurse the plant, havest and then fulfil orders to exchange gold. 
You use gold to buy seeds, pots and other items in shop. You can adopt a dog to protect your garden from theft, increase the profit by invest in other gardens, saving money by adopt birds.
I didn't join the project from the start but I optimized a lot of features written by others (using my freetime). The result is the game can run on 1GB Ram devices and the bundle size is lighter. Then after a year, my manager gave me the right to lead the client side of the game. It boosted me a lot of experiences and confident.
