# Lupin Adventure

This is a game demo I worked with 2 other classmates in university. It's 2D platform game. Player control the character to pass through all the levels and kill the evils. After each boss, the character will get a familiar to help them. The game has 11 maps and features a lot physics objects like: Spring, Rope, Ladder. This game can improve a lot more because the technical underlying is very good.
